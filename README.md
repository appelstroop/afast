# afast

A cli to track your time in the Xebia x3/ afas environment. I wanted to see if I could mimic the AFAS website in a command line tool, including 2FA. Seems that it works

## Installing

Not on NPM so: 

```sh
npm install -g https://github.com/appelstroop/afast
```

## Usage

Then:

```sh
afast login
```
